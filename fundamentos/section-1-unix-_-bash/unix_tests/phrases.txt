I must not fear.
Fear is the mind-killer.
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
I will face my fear.
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
And whem it has gone past i will turn the inner eye to see its path.
where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
Only i will remain.
